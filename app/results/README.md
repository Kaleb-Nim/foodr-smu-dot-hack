# Enhanced Results Page

This directory contains the implementation of the Enhanced Results Page with Weighted Scoring and SMU Campus Integration feature (GitHub Issue #4).

## Features

- **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Superlikes (+3), Likes (+1), Dislikes (-1)
- **Top 8 Dishes Display**: Ranked by algorithmic scoring
- **Horizontal Progress Bars**: Visual scoring representation with numerical values
- **SMU Campus Restaurant Counts**: Shows available restaurants near SMU for each cuisine
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, tooltips, and smooth animations

## Structure

```
/app/results/
├── page.tsx                          # Main results page with sample data

## Supporting Files

- `/lib/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript interfaces
- `/lib/scoring.ts` - Weighted scoring algorithm and sample data
- `/data/smu-restaurants.ts` - SMU campus restaurant data
- `/components/ui/score-bar.tsx` - Enhanced progress bar component

## Usage

1. **View Results Page**: Navigate to `/results` to see the isolated implementation
2. **Sample Data**: Uses generated sample data with 4 users and 10 dishes
3. **Responsive Layout**: Winner card highlighted, remaining dishes in grid
4. **Interactive Elements**: Hover for tooltips, expandable dish list

## Integration Notes

This implementation is designed to be isolated from the existing `/app/swipe/` components to avoid conflicts with concurrent development. Key integration points:

- **Data Flow**: Expects `EnhancedMatchedFoodItem[]` from scoring algorithm
- **Props Interface**: Compatible with existing handler patterns
- **Styling**: Uses existing design system and UI components
- **State Management**: Self-contained, ready for parent component integration

## Testing

The page includes comprehensive sample data covering:
- Various score scenarios (high, medium, low, negative)
- Different cuisine types with restaurant counts
- Edge cases (ties, single votes, polarizing dishes)
- Responsive design across device sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**: Connect with swipe functionality once development is complete
2. **Real Data**: Replace sample data with actual API calls
3. **Performance**: Optimize for larger datasets and group sizes
4. **Enhancement**: Add more detailed restaurant information and filters
